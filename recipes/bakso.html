        <h3>Bouncy Beef Meatball Recipe (Resep Bakso Daging Sapi Kenyal)</h3>
        <p>The key to bouncy meatballs without preservatives is using very cold meat (you can use ice cubes) and a quick mixing process using a food processor or blender.</p>

        <h4>Key Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>500 gr ground beef, lean</li>
        <li>100 gr tapioca flour or sago flour</li>
        <li>80 - 100 gr ice cubes, crushed small</li>
        <li>1 egg white</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground white pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Fine Spices (blended/pounded):</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>4-5 cloves garlic, fried until fragrant</li>
        <li>3 shallots, fried until fragrant</li>
        </ul>


        <h4>How to Make the Meatball Dough:</h4>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Process the Meat:</strong> Put the cold ground meat into a food processor or blender. Process until the meat starts to smooth out.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Ice Cubes:</strong> While continuing to process, gradually add the crushed ice cubes. Process until the mixture becomes a smooth and thick paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Spices and Other Ingredients:</strong> Add the egg white, fine spices, tapioca flour, salt, sugar, ground pepper, and baking powder. Process again until all ingredients are well mixed and the dough feels sticky and dense.</li>
        <li><strong>Test the Taste:</strong> Take a small amount of dough, boil it or heat it in the microwave to taste test. Add more seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Shape the Meatballs:</strong> Boil water in a large pot, then reduce the heat so the water is just simmering slowly. Take the meatball dough in your hand, make a fist, and squeeze so the dough comes out through the gap between your thumb and index finger. Use a spoon to scoop the meatballs and gently drop them into the hot water.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Meatballs:</strong> Cook the meatballs over low to medium heat. The meatballs will float to the surface when they are done. Let them float for 3-4 minutes after floating to ensure they are cooked through.</li>
        <li><strong>Soak in Ice Water:</strong> Lift the cooked meatballs out and immediately place them in a basin of ice water to stop the cooking process and achieve a bouncy texture.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
